## Testing

### System tests

**Windows**

1. Open a DOS window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.bat` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

**Mac/Unix/Linux**

1. Open a terminal window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.sh` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

### JUnit tests

* In Eclipse, right-click on the `test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

### Troubleshooting test failures

* Problem: How do I examine the exact differences between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`?<br>
  Solution: You can use a diff/merge tool with a GUI e.g. WinMerge (on Windows)
* Problem: The two files look exactly the same, but the test script reports they are different.<br>
  Solution: This can happen because the line endings used by Windows is different from Unix-based
  OSes. Convert the actual.txt to the format used by your OS using some [utility](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux).
* Problem: Test fails during the very first time.<br>
  Solution: The output of the very first test run could be slightly different because the program
  creates a new storage file. Tests should pass from the 2nd run onwards.
